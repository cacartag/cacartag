- 👋 Hi, I’m @cacartag
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Scala and learning more about the language 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to scrape analyze and process data for personal, financial, and out of boredom
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that has scala that does not completely go over my head after first seeing it
- 📫 How to reach me: I guess through github, idk....
